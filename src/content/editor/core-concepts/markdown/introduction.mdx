The Markdown extension provides bidirectional markdown support for your Tiptap editor—parse markdown strings into Tiptap's JSON format and serialize editor content back to markdown.

## Core Capabilities

- **Markdown Parsing**: Convert markdown strings to Tiptap JSON
- **Markdown Serialization**: Export editor content as markdown
- **Custom Tokenizers**: Add support for custom markdown syntax
- **Extensible Architecture**: Each extension can define its own parsing and rendering logic
- **HTML Support**: Parse HTML embedded in markdown using Tiptap's existing HTML parsing

## How It Works

The Markdown extension acts as a bridge between markdown text and Tiptap's JSON document structure. Here's how the core components work together:

### Architecture

```
Markdown String
      ↓
   marked.js Lexer (Tokenization)
      ↓
   Markdown Tokens
      ↓
   Extension Parse Handlers
      ↓
   Tiptap JSON
```

And in reverse:

```
Tiptap JSON
      ↓
   Extension Render Handlers
      ↓
   Markdown String
```

### Key Components

#### 1. The Markdown Extension

The main extension that you add to your editor. It provides:

- The `getMarkdown()` method on the editor instance
- Modified `setContent()`, `insertContent()`, and `insertContentAt()` commands with `asMarkdown` option
- The `contentAsMarkdown` editor option for setting initial content
- A `MarkdownManager` instance accessible via `editor.markdown`

#### 2. MarkdownManager

The core engine that handles parsing and serialization. It:

- Wraps and configures the marked.js instance
- Maintains a registry of extension handlers
- Coordinates between markdown tokens and Tiptap JSON nodes
- Manages mark boundaries during serialization
- Handles indentation for nested structures

#### 3. The Marked Lexer

The marked.js Lexer is responsible for tokenizing markdown text into a structured token stream. For example, the markdown:

```markdown
# Hello **World**
```

Becomes tokens like:

```js
[
  {
    type: 'heading',
    depth: 1,
    tokens: [
      { type: 'text', text: 'Hello ' },
      {
        type: 'strong',
        tokens: [{ type: 'text', text: 'World' }],
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

#### 4. Extension Handlers

Each Tiptap extension can provide markdown support by defining handlers in its `markdown` config:

```typescript
markdown: {
  name: 'strong',              // Token name to match
  parse: (token, helpers) => { /* ... */ },
  render: (node, helpers) => { /* ... */ }
}
```

The handlers translate between markdown tokens and Tiptap nodes in both directions.

## Why marked.js?

This extension integrates [marked.js](https://marked.js.org) as its parser:

- **Fast and Lightweight**: One of the fastest markdown parsers available
- **Extensible**: Custom tokenizers enable non-standard markdown syntax
- **CommonMark Compliant**: Follows the CommonMark specification
- **Battle-tested**: Widely used in production with active development

The Lexer API breaks markdown into tokens that map naturally to Tiptap's node structure, making the integration clean and maintainable. The extension works identically in browser and server environments.
