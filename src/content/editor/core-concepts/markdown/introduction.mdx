The Markdown extension provides bidirectional markdown support for your Tiptap editor—parse markdown strings into Tiptap's JSON format and serialize editor content back to markdown.

## Core Capabilities

- **Markdown Parsing**: Convert markdown strings to Tiptap JSON
- **Markdown Serialization**: Export editor content as markdown
- **Custom Tokenizers**: Add support for custom markdown syntax
- **Extensible Architecture**: Each extension can define its own parsing and rendering logic
- **Utilities to simplify custom syntax creation**: `createBlockMarkdownSpec`, `createInlineMarkdownSpec` and more
- **HTML Support**: Parse HTML embedded in markdown using Tiptap's existing HTML parsing

## How It Works

The Markdown extension acts as a bridge between markdown text and Tiptap's JSON document structure. Here's how the core components work together:

### Architecture

```
Markdown String
      ↓
   marked.js Lexer (Tokenization)
      ↓
   Markdown Tokens
      ↓
   Extension Parse Handlers
      ↓
   Tiptap JSON
```

And in reverse:

```
Tiptap JSON
      ↓
   Extension Render Handlers
      ↓
   Markdown String
```

## Key Components

### `MarkdownManager`

The `MarkdownManager` class is the core engine that Handles parsing and serialization. It:

- Wraps and configures the marked.js instance
- Maintains a registry of extension handlers
- Creates the [Lexer](#lexer) instance and registers all [Tokenizers](#tokenizer).
- Coordinates between markdown tokens and Tiptap JSON nodes

### `Markdown` extension

The `Markdown` extension is the main extension that you add to your editor. It provides:

- Overrides for all **content-related** commands on the editor to support markdown input/output
- The `getMarkdown()` method to serialize content as markdown
- The `setContent()` command with `asMarkdown` option to parse markdown input
- Access to the [`MarkdownManager`](#markdownmanager) instance via `editor.markdown`

### Extension Handlers

Each Tiptap extension can provide markdown support by defining handlers in its `markdown` config:

```typescript
markdown: {
  name: 'strong',              // Token name to match
  parse: (token, helpers) => { /* ... */ },
  render: (node, helpers) => { /* ... */ }
}
```

The handlers translate between markdown tokens and Tiptap nodes in both directions and are automatically registered
by the [`MarkdownManager`](#markdownmanager), creating [Tokenizers](#tokenizer) out of them and registering those to the [Lexer](#lexer).

## Glossary of Terms

Before we dive into the details, here are some key terms we'll be using throughout this guide:

### Token

A plain JavaScript object that represents a piece of the parsed Markdown. For example, a heading token might look like `{ type: "heading", depth: 2, text: "Hello" }`. Tokens are the “lego bricks” that describe the document’s structure.

- A token is a structured representation of a piece of markdown syntax produced by the [marked.js](https://marked.js.org) parser.
- Each token has a `type` (like `heading`, `paragraph`, `list`, etc.)
- Each token may include additional properties relevant to that type (like `depth` for headings, `ordered` for lists, etc.).
- Tokens can also contain nested tokens in properties like `tokens` or `items`, representing the hierarchical structure of the markdown content.
- A token is not directly usable by Tiptap; it needs to be transformed into Tiptap's JSON format.
- Tokens are created via a [Tokenizer](#tokenizer).
- We can create our own tokens by implementing a [Custom Tokenizer](./custom-tokenizers).

> **Note**: Marked.js comes with built-in tokenizers for standard markdown syntax, but you can extend or replace these by providing custom tokenizers to the MarkdownManager.
>
> You can find the list of default tokens in the [marked.js types](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/src/Tokens.ts).

#### Tiptap JSON

- Has nothing to do with Markdown and is the JSON format used by Tiptap and ProseMirror to represent the document structure.
- Tiptap JSON consists of nodes and marks, each with a `type`, optional `attrs`, and optional `content` or `text`.
- Nodes represent block-level elements (like paragraphs, headings, lists), while marks represent inline formatting (like bold, italic, links).
- Tiptap JSON is hierarchical, with nodes containing other nodes or text, reflecting the document's structure.
- We can use **token** to create **Tiptap JSON** that the editor can understand.

Now that we understand the difference between a Token and Tiptap JSON, let's dive into how to parse tokens and serialize Tiptap content.

### Tokenizer

The set of functions (or rules) that scan the raw Markdown text and decide how to turn chunks of it into tokens. For example, it recognizes `## Heading` and produces a `heading` token. You can customize or override tokenizers to change how Markdown is interpreted.

You can find out how to create custom tokenizers in the [Custom Tokenizers](./custom-tokenizers) guide.

### Lexer

The orchestrator that runs through the entire Markdown string, applies the [tokenizers](#tokenizer) in sequence, and produces the full list of tokens. Think of it as the machine that repeatedly feeds text into the tokenizers until the whole input is tokenized.

You don't need to touch the lexer directly, because Tiptap is already creating a lexer instance that will be reused for the lifetime of your editor.
This lexer instance will automatically register all [tokenizers](#tokenizer) from your extensions.

## Why marked.js?

This extension integrates [marked.js](https://marked.js.org) as its parser:

- **Fast and Lightweight**: One of the fastest markdown parsers available
- **Extensible**: Custom tokenizers enable non-standard markdown syntax
- **CommonMark Compliant**: Follows the CommonMark specification
- **Battle-tested**: Widely used in production with active development

The Lexer API breaks markdown into tokens that map naturally to Tiptap's node structure, making the integration clean and maintainable. The extension works identically in browser and server environments.
