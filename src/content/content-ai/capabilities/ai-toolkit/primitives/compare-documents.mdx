Compare two documents in real time and optionally show the diff as suggestions in the editor.

## `startComparingDocuments`

Starts real-time comparison with another document. Differences are displayed as suggestions in an inline diff view where the old and the new content are displayed in the editor.

### Parameters (`StartComparingDocumentsOptions`)

- `otherDoc?` (`Node`): The document to compare against. Defaults to a snapshot of the current document if omitted
- `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Controls how differences are rendered as suggestions
  - `showAsDiff?` (`boolean`): Show alternative content as a diff widget. Default: `true` in comparison flows
  - `diffPosition?` (`'before' | 'after'`): Where to display the diff relative to the suggestion. Default: `'before'`
  - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Attributes added to rendered elements
  - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Custom rendering function
- `debounceTimeout?` (`number`): Milliseconds to wait before recomputing diffs. Default: `500`

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing changes with another document
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc,
})
```

## `stopComparingDocuments`

Stops the real-time comparison and clears all suggestions, so the diff view is no longer visible.

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Stop comparison and clear decorations
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```

## `applySuggestionToOtherDoc`

Applies a specific suggestion by its ID to the other document when comparing documents in real-time. The "other document" is the document that is being compared to the current document.

### Parameters

- `suggestionId` (`string`): The unique identifier of the suggestion to apply

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing documents
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc: otherDoc,
})

// Get all suggestions
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Apply the first suggestion to the other document
if (suggestions.length > 0) {
  toolkit.applySuggestionToOtherDoc(suggestions[0].id)
}
```
