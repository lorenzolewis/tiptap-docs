  title: Get document metadata | Tiptap Content AI
  description: Provide schema awareness to AI models so they understand nodes, marks, and attributes.
  category: Content AI
---

These methods help the AI get more information about the document and understand its properties and structure.

## `getSchemaAwareness`

Returns a string describing the document's schema. A Tiptap schema describes the elements the document can (and cannot) contain.

Without the schema awareness string, the AI model might generate content that the Tiptap Editor cannot support. For example, it might generate a table in a document that does not support tables.

If you provide the schema awareness string to the AI model, the AI model will know that table nodes are not supported and will not generate them.

Currently, the `getSchemaAwareness` method only supports AI models that generate HTML content. We plan to add support for other formats in the future.

### Parameters (`GetSchemaAwarenessOptions`)

- `customNodes?` (`SchemaAwarenessItem[]`): Custom schema awareness items to include in addition to the default ones. Defaults to `[]`

### Returns

- `string`: Human-readable schema awareness text suitable for system prompts

### Example

If your document contains custom nodes or marks, you can include them in the schema awareness string by providing the `customNodes` option.

```ts
// Include a custom node in the awareness text
const awareness = toolkit.getSchemaAwareness({
  customNodes: [
    {
      extensionName: 'alert',
      tag: 'div[data-alert]',
      name: 'Alert Box',
      description:
        'A highlighted box used to display important information, warnings, or tips to the user',
      // Describe the HTML attributes of the node as it is rendered in HTML
      attributes: [
        {
          name: 'data-alert',
          // Specify the "value" property if the attribute always has that value
          value: '',
          description: 'Indicates that this is an alert box',
        },
        {
          name: 'data-type',
          description: 'The type of alert: info, warning, error, or success',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```
