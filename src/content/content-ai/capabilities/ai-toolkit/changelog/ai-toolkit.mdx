# @tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit

## 3.0.0-alpha.17

### Major Changes

- Improve tool definitions of `readSelection` and `insertContent` tools to fix a bug where the AI inserts the content in the wrong place if the user changes the selection after the AI reads the selection.

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue in `streamHtml` and `streamText` methods where a `ReadableStream` was not accepted as a parameter

## 3.0.0-alpha.16

### Major Changes

- Renamed `detailedDiff` to `diffMode` in review options to control how to display the difference between the original and the modified content

## 3.0.0-alpha.15

### Major Changes

- Add `detailedDiff` option to review options to control whether to display the change as a detailed diff. Rename `showDiff` option to `detailedDiff` for clarity
- Add `detailedDiff` option to tool execution and streaming options to control whether to display the change as a detailed diff, and set it to `true` by default so that the changes are displayed as a detailed diff by default

## 3.0.0-alpha.14

### Major Changes

- Requires upgrading to a version of these provider libraries that is equal or higher than:
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions@3.0.0-alpha.4`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-ai-sdk@3.0.0-alpha.7`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-langchain@3.0.0-alpha.3`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-openai@3.0.0-alpha.2`
- Remove `currentChunk` parameter and return value from the `executeTool` method
  - The `executeTool` method no longer accepts `currentChunk` parameter
  - The `executeTool` method no longer returns `currentChunk` field
- Add `getActiveNodeRange` method to get the active node range. The active node range is the range of top-level nodes that can be edited in the next tool call, it helps the AI make more precise edits when editing the document with the `applyDiff` tool. It replaces the `currentChunk` parameter.
- Add `setActiveNodeRange` method to set the active node range
- Remove tools `readFirstChunk`, `readNextChunk` and `readPreviousChunk`.
- Add `readNodeRange` tool. This tool allows the AI to read any range of top-level nodes in the document. It is much more flexible than the previous chunk-based reading tools.

### Minor Changes

- Add `streamTool` method to stream a tool call into the editor

## 3.0.0-alpha.13

### Minor Changes

- Add `metadata` option to review options to add custom metadata and properties to the suggestions that are generated during review mode
- Add `streamText` and `streamHtml` methods to stream text and HTML content into the editor

- Fix issue in suggestions diff view where extra elements like paragraphs were displayed in the suggestion diff content

## 3.0.0-alpha.12

## 3.0.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue in `diffUtility` where identical empty documents were considered different

## 3.0.0-alpha.10

### Major Changes

- Add `replaceDocumentWhereChanged` method to replace the entire document in an efficient way, so that not all the document is marked as replaced, but only the parts of the document that have changed
- Re-implement `applyHtmlDiff` and `rejectAllChanges` methods to use `replaceDocumentWhereChanged`

## 3.0.0-alpha.9

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

### Major Changes

- Add `acceptChange` and `rejectChange` methods to accept and reject changes when comparing documents in real-time

- Improve accuracy of `getHtmlRange`, `getJsonRange`, and `getTextRange` methods when returning the chunk index

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes
