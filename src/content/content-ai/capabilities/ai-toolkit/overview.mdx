The **AI Toolkit** is a flexible set of methods added on top of Tiptap, designed to help you build AI agents and AI extensions.

## Features

- **AI Agent tools**: Add text-editing tools to your AI Agent
- **Primitives**: Methods that you can use to build your own AI extensions
  - **Read documents**: Get the document's content as JSON, HTML, or Text, in a format that's easy to use for AI models
  - **Edit documents**: Apply precise edits to the document from AI-generated content
  - **Get metadata**: Inform the AI model about the document's schema and structure
  - **Display suggestions**: Let users review AI-generated content and provide feedback
  - **Compare documents** in real-time and show a diff view

## Get started

## Example usage

Install the package:

Add the extension to your editor and access its methods:

```tsx
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import { AiToolkit, getAiToolkit } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [StarterKit, AiToolkit],
})

// Get the AI Toolkit instance
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

// Call the AI Toolkit methods
toolkit.insertText('AI-generated content')
```
