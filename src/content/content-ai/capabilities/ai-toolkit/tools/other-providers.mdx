The Tiptap AI Toolkit provides tool definitions for the most popular AI provider libraries, like the Vercel AI SDK. If your AI provider is not supported, [reach out to the Tiptap team](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev) so we can add support for it in future releases.

Another option is to build your own adapter library. This can be useful if you've built your AI Agent in another language (for example, Python) and you want to use the tool definitions from the Tiptap AI Toolkit.

To do this, call `toolDefinitions()` and log the result to understand the structure.

```ts
import { toolDefinitions } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-ai-sdk'

console.log(toolDefinitions())
```

Use the printed schema to build the tool definitions in your provider's tool calling format (e.g., Python backends).
