## `diffUtility`

Compares two Tiptap documents and returns a list of changes between them.

### Parameters (`DiffUtilityOptions`)

- `docA` (`Node`): Original document
- `docB` (`Node`): Modified document
- `simplifyChanges?` (`boolean`): Whether to simplify the changes so that if there are multiple changes in the same word, they are merged into one change. Defaults to `true`

### Returns (`Change[]`)

Returns a list of changes. Each `Change` item contains:

- `rangeA` (`Range`): The range in the original document that has changed
- `rangeB` (`Range`): The range in the modified document that has changed

### Example

```ts
// Compute changes between two documents
import { diffUtility } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit'
const changes = diffUtility({ docA, docB })
```
